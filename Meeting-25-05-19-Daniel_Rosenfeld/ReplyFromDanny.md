Dea Hao Huang,

Thanks for following up on our meeting.
I am glad that you and the students find my comments helpful.

Here are my initial responses to the plans of the three students:


3. Fan Bo:

Let me remind you that I suggested that most, if not all, of your observations can be explained based on cloud base temperature. 
Please first explain the physical mechanisms that may explain these differences between the warm and cold cloud-based cloud properties.
After that, I suggest that you try statistical analyses to see how much of the variability of cloud base and other properties can be explained.
The statistics are merely a tool for validating or negating physical hypotheses.


I suggest sending me slightly revised plans based on these comments.

Best regards,
Danny
